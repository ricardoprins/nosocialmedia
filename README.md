# "Say No To Social Media" Manifesto

Time is short. Time is precious. Time, in fact, is the most valuable asset we have. It is my opinion that we should not waste such precious resource. Therefore, in light of so many recent data on the harmful effects of social media, I have decided to stop using it. 

And I invite others to do so.
