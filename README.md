# "Say No To Social Media" Manifesto

Time is short. Time is precious. Time, in fact, is the most valuable asset we have. It is my opinion that we should not waste such precious resource. Therefore, in light of so much recent data on the harmful effects of social media, I have decided to stop using it. 

And I invite others to do so.

Use your time wisely. Get better. Don't give time and money to social media crap.
